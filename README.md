## Background

Daymet weather variables include daily minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure, shortwave radiation, snow water equivalent, and day length produced on a 1 km x 1 km gridded surface over continental North America and Hawaii from 1980 and over Puerto Rico from 1950 through the end of the most recent full calendar year.

Daymet data documentation: https://daac.ornl.gov/DAYMET/guides/Daymet_Daily_V4.html

Note: The Daymet calendar is based on a standard calendar year. All Daymet years, including leap years, have 1â€“365 days. For leap years, the Daymet data include leap day (February 29) and December 31 is discarded from leap years to maintain a 365-day year.

## Using

If `my_addresses.csv` is a file in the current working directory with ID column `id`, start and end date columns `start_date` and `end_date`, and coordinate columns named `lat` and `lon`, then the [DeGAUSS command](https://degauss.org/using_degauss.html#DeGAUSS_Commands):

```sh
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/tmp ghcr.io/degauss-org/daymet:0.1.0 my_addresses.csv
```

will produce `my_addresses_daymet_0.1.0.csv` with added columns:

- **`tmax`**: maximum temperature
- **`tmin`**: minimum temperature
- **`srad`**: solar radiation
- **`vp`**: vapor pressure
- **`swe`**: snow water equivalent
- **`prcp`**: precipitation
- **`dayl`**: day length

### Optional Argument

- Optional arguments include:
- **`vars`**: [Optional] Comma-separated string of Daymet variables: "tmax,tmin,srad,vp,swe,prcp,dayl". Default is to download and link all Daymet variables.
- **`min_lon`**: [Optional] Minimum longitude (in decimal degrees) of bounding box for Daymet data download. Default is to infer bounding box from address coordinates.
- **`max_lon`**: [Optional] Maximum longitude (in decimal degrees) of bounding box for Daymet data download. Default is to infer bounding box from address coordinates.
- **`min_lat`**: [Optional] Minimum latitude (in decimal degrees) of bounding box for Daymet data download. Default is to infer bounding box from address coordinates.
- **`max_lat`**: [Optional] Maximum latitude (in decimal degrees) of bounding box for Daymet data download. Default is to infer bounding box from address coordinates.
- **`region`**: [Optional] Daymet spatial region ("na" for continental North America, "hi" for Hawaii, or "pr" for Puerto Rico). Default is continental North America.

## Geomarker Methods

- If needed, put details here about the methods and assumptions used in the geomarker assessment process.

## Geomarker Data

- List how geomarker was created, ideally including any scripts within the repo used to do so or linking to an external repository
- If applicable, list where geomarker data is stored in S3 using a hyperlink like: [`s3://path/to/daymet.rds`](https://geomarker.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/path/to/daymet.rds)
