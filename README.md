## Background

Daymet weather variables include daily minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure, shortwave radiation, snow water equivalent, and day length produced on a 1 km x 1 km gridded surface over continental North America and Hawaii from 1980 and over Puerto Rico from 1950 through the end of the most recent full calendar year.

Daymet data documentation: https://daac.ornl.gov/DAYMET/guides/Daymet_Daily_V4.html

Note: The Daymet calendar is based on a standard calendar year. All Daymet years, including leap years, have 1â€“365 days. For leap years, the Daymet data include leap day (February 29) and December 31 is discarded from leap years to maintain a 365-day year.

## Using

If `my_addresses.csv` is a file in the current working directory with ID column `id`, start and end date columns `start_date` and `end_date`, and coordinate columns named `lat` and `lon`, then the [DeGAUSS command](https://degauss.org/using_degauss.html#DeGAUSS_Commands):

```sh
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/tmp ghcr.io/degauss-org/daymet:0.2.0 my_addresses.csv
```

will produce `my_addresses_daymet_0.2.0.csv` with added columns:

- **`tmax`**: maximum temperature
- **`tmin`**: minimum temperature

Other columns may be present in the input `my_addresses.csv` file, and these other columns will be linked in and included in the output `my_addresses_daymet_0.1.0.csv` file.

### Optional Arguments

There are no optional arguments associated with this package. All arguments are pre-coded or inferred from the address file.

## Geomarker Methods

Daymet data on a specified date is linked to coordinate data within the `my_addresses.csv` file by matching on the Daymet 1 km x 1 km raster cell number.

## Geomarker Data

- This package takes pre-downloaded environmental data from [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov/) as netCDF file(s).
- The R code that links the environmental data to the input coordinates is within `entrypoint.R`.

## Warning

If the bounding box for Daymet data download is inferred from address coordinates, then the size of the Daymet data download may be quite large if the address coordinates are very spread out. If a wide spread of coordinates is desired, then it may be best to stratify your input dataset to coordinates within separate geographic regions.

## DeGAUSS Details

The Daymet DeGAUSS package was created by Ben Barrett and Peter Graffy.
